### Abstract

Heavy exposure to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb), the etiologic agent of tuberculosis and
among the top infectious killers worldwide, results in infection that is cleared, contained, or
progresses to disease. Some heavily exposed tuberculosis contacts show no evidence of infection
using the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) yet the
mechanisms underlying this ‘resister’ (RSTR) phenotype are unclear. To identify transcriptional
responses that distinguish RSTR monocytes, we performed RNAseq on monocytes isolated from
heavily exposed household contacts in Uganda and gold miners in South Africa after ex vivo
Mtb infection. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed several gene pathways that were
consistently enriched in response to Mtb among RSTR subjects as compared to controls with
positive TST/IGRA testing (LTBI) across Uganda and South Africa. The most significantly
enriched gene set in which expression was increased in RSTR relative to LTBI Mtb-infected
monocytes was the TNFα signaling pathway whose core enrichment (leading edge) substantially
overlapped across RSTR populations. These leading edge genes included candidate resistance
genes (ABCA1, DUSP2) with significantly increased expression among Uganda RSTRs (FDR
<0.1). The distinct monocyte transcriptional response to Mtb among RSTR subjects, including
increased expression of the TNF signaling pathway, highlights genes and inflammatory pathways
that may mediate resistance to TST/IGRA conversion and provides therapeutic targets to
enhance host restriction of Mtb intracellular infection.
