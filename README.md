### Abstract

**Background**: Heavy exposure to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb), the etiologic agent of tuberculosis and among the top infectious killers worldwide, results in infection that is cleared, contained, or progresses to disease. Defining the early immunologic responses that determine these outcomes may identify novel therapeutic targets. Some heavily exposed tuberculosis contacts show no evidence of infection using the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and we explore transcriptional responses in monocytes from these Mtb resisters (RSTR).

**Methods**: We performed RNAseq on monocytes infected in vitro that were isolated from heavily-exposed household contacts in Uganda and gold miners in South Africa. The Mtb transcriptional response was compared in RSTR versus controls with latent Mtb infection (LTBI).

**Findings**: We identified 260 transcripts in the Uganda cohort and five in South Africa that were differentially expressed genes (DEG) in response to Mtb and specific to RSTR. Although there was no DEG overlap across cohorts, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed several gene pathways that were consistently enriched in response to Mtb among RSTR subjects across Uganda and South Africa. The most significantly enriched gene set in which expression was increased in RSTR relative to LTBI Mtb-infected monocytes, but not uninfected monocytes, was the TNFa signaling pathway.

**Interpretation**: The distinct monocyte transcriptional response to Mtb among RSTR subjects highlights genes and inflammatory pathways that may mediate resistance to TST/IGRA conversion.
